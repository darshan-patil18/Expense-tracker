## Expense Tracker Web App

Keep track of where your money goes with this small **expense tracker web app** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It runs completely in the browser and saves your data locally, so you can close the tab and come back later without losing anything.

### What you can do
- **Set a budget** and update it anytime
- **Add expenses with tags** (Food, Shopping, Subscription, or your own custom tags)
- **See total budget, total expenses, and how much money is left**
- **View a clear history of all expenses** with date and time
- **Edit or delete any expense** if you make a mistake
- **Sort expenses by amount** (high to low / low to high)
- **See a simple pie chart** that compares your total expenses vs your remaining budget (Chart.js)

All data (budget, expenses, tags) is stored in the browser using **localStorage**, so it stays saved even after you refresh or reopen the page.

### How to run it
- Easiest: just open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or, if you prefer: open the folder in VS Code and use **Live Server** (or any static server) to serve the project, then open it in the browser.
